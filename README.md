# Pathfinder Healthcare Navigation Wordpress Build

This site was made for my mother's new business in healthcare advocacy.

I chose to focus on simplicity and accessibility. I also had to work with the artist hired for the branding to be sure we created a site that is unique while still usable on all devices and by users with all levels of ability.

I used Bootstrap 4 to help stand this up quickly, and then added custom styles for components that I needed.

In terms of plugins, the main one used is Advanced Custom Fields Pro to help me make the authoring role more user friendly on the back end, while being flexible on the front end.

You can visit the site at www.pathfinderhealthnav.ca.

The only thing that I haven't added yet is the testimonial section, which is waiting for the business to really get up and running.
